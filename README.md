My playground to dockerize asterisk configuration

Work in progress

directory `sshdocker` contains a stand alone debian based container accessible via SSH

To build an asterisk image that has just asterisk Compiled :

```
cd asterisk
docker build -t asterisk:basecomp .
```


```
cd asteriskconf
docker build -t asterisk:conf
```

to run the container :

```
docker run -d -p <sshport:22> -p 5060:5060 asterisk
```
replace sshport with whatever you want to avoid standard 22 port.

Not able at this stage to start properly asterisk from an ENTRYPOINT or CMD in image. Once the container is started, connect to it using ssh and run
```
asterisk start
```
